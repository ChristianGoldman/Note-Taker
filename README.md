## My story
* This project enabled me to better understand how back end communicates with the front end
* Server routes and paths make a lot more sense to me and why they are necessary
* The app can help users better organize their lives, and keep a list of to-do's throughout the day
* The toughest part of the assingment for me was understanding when a "WriteFile" or "ReadFile" was needed.
## Features ##
* I have code setup for future adjustments to this project that will enable a user to edit previously saved notes
* You can add or remove as many notes as you please and the page will automatically display your changes without having to refresh
* Future ideas what add a date with the notes if you need to keep track of things based upon time
